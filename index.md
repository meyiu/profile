## 2. Interest in IT

Through the development of technology in recent years, I have grown interest in the future of technology and how it will affect society and the environment. My interest in IT started through sci-fi & cyberpunk Japanese animations such as Psycho Pass, Ghost in the Shell and Akira.

The futuristic environment and aspects of these series was what started my interest in IT and has made me wonder how technology would evolve in the future. The animation and visuals also made me interested in the production and design process of the series. Furthermore, I enjoy online shopping, thus I am also interested in how the fashion and clothing industry efficiently use technology to broaden their target market. I chose RMIT because I have heard that the IT course here is very interesting and has a good balance of both practical work and theories. Since I am new to IT, I expect to learn a lot more about this subject and how it will develop and change society in the future.

I would also use these results to find various types of team members to ensure that our group will be able to work on each of our strengths and weaknesses.

## 5. Project Ideas

__Overview__

My project idea is developing a fashion smartphone app. The app will update latest fashion trends and upcoming releases from famous streetwear brands. Furthermore, it will provide product information, availability and links to nearby stores and website links. This allows the user not having to search online and to purchase easily from the app. It will also have a global market where brands and other enthusiasts can buy, sell and trade their collection. This will allow users to purchase rare items or brand’s previous season collection. I will also develop a gallery where users can show off their collection to help entice the target market to purchase more products. It will have a ranking system where users can vote for the best outfit every week, which will be featured on the app’s main page. Moreover, there will be a forum for users to discuss and ask questions relevant to fashion. There will also be a special forum to help users identify certain products or brands. 

__Motivation__

From my experiences in online shopping, it gets very cluttered when looking at different websites for different kinds of products. Furthermore, it is also difficult to search websites for availability of products and the legitimacy of the seller. A lot of streetwear brands are also exclusive to certain countries or seasons, thus are very difficult to acquire. Therefore, I want to develop a fashion hub to allow users worldwide to enjoy the services provided in the app. 

__Description__

The smartphone app will have a home page with images of the current fashion news and new releases available for purchase. 

__Tools & Technologies__

To create this smartphone app, I will mainly be using MIT App Inventor. Furthermore, I will be using various fashion websites to provide latest fashion news, upcoming release dates and other products available for sale. 

__Skills__

The hardware required for my project include a PC and smartphone, as I will be using an application to create it. Furthermore, since the development will be on an app, there will be no specific coding skills required.

__Outcome__

If the project is successful, I will be able to create a fashion hub for users all over the world to be able to browse and trade their favourite streetwear collections. Moreover, this will allow users to not have to spend too long searching different websites and having to worry about illegitimate sellers in the market. It will allow users to easily access and purchase clothing items easier and will hopefully encourage not only bigger brands, but individuals that want to sell their own products as well.
